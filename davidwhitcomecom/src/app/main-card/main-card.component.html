                <p>Even when I was little, developing computer programs interested me. I became involved in
                    computer science when I started building small computer games in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameMaker_Studio">Game
                        Maker</a>. As I dove into the world of programming at 14 years old, I developed
                    websites and started writing simple code. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                    and PHP to show off the small video games that I made.</p>
                <p>I've developed numerous applications being used in the real world - from small programs to
                    this website. You can find some of my active projects and the code for this website on <a
                        href="https://github.com/Whit128">GitHub</a>.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I like to play guitar, sing, and master music in post production. You can
                    find some of my music on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/david-whitcome">SoundCloud</a>. I
                    won first place for the song "<a href="https://soundcloud.com/david-whitcome/tradition">Tradition</a>"
                    in McHenry County College's Voices Magazine in 2015. I'm also a proud Eagle Scout in the
                    Boy Scouts of America as of August 2014.</p>
